		<p> I am currently a senior at the University of Rochester pursuing 2 Bachelor of Arts degrees: Computer Science and Business with a cluster in Studio Art. In the past 3 years, I have taken classes in economics, psychology, marketing, and web development. Through Product Design, I discovered I could use my passions for creativity, technology, and business in a fulfilling career.</p>

		<p> For as long as I can remember, I have been drawn to the arts. I grew up playing with paint sets, drawing in my sketch book, singing everywhere I went, and experimenting on Adobe Photoshop. In high school, I began to make my own handmade cards, fell in love with hand embroidery, got more involved with photography, self-learned guitar, and explored filmmaking & ceramics. In college, I continue to enjoy the arts by taking courses in drawing, photography, and singing in the Eastman Women's Choir.</p>

		<p> Although I loved my science and math courses, I longed for a way to integrate creativity in my future career since my free time only seemed to get shorter. After taking a course in front end web development my freshman year, I realized I could use my creativity and problem-solving skills in the field of User Experience. I have done internships for a startup and professional-services firm, gaining experience in UX research and designing interfaces for mobile applications. My portfolio includes work done for companies, courses during college, and personal projects.</p>

		<p> In my free time, I love learning about nutrition and prioritizing my health & fitness by going to the gym. Currently, I am binge watching interior design and vegetarian cooking videos. While I don't get to sing in my choir as often as I would like, I am very connected to music and have over 25 playlists on Spotify to match my mood at any point throughout the day! I enjoy exploring new places and ideas, and focus on maintaining a life of adventure and mindfulness.</p>
